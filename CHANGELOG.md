* dataStore and authStore now default to using mastersecret credentials and not executing business logic
* Circular requests to userStore/dataStore (e.g. saving back to the sae collection in a post hook) now must not execute BL and must be executed under masterSecret credentials.
* Some internal refactoring
* DEPRECATED:  Passing the entity directly in the `complete()` method.  Will be removed in future version.
* DEPRECATED:  useMasterSecret argument for userStore and dataStore.  Stores now default to using master secret.  Use `useUserContext` to use the context of the current user for dataStore or userStore requests.
